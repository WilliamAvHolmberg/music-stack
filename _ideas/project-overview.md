# Project Overview: AI-Driven Web Accessibility Enhancement Tool

## Context
The European Accessibility Act (EAA) requires businesses to meet specific web accessibility standards by June 2025. This project aims to develop an AI-powered tool to help businesses achieve compliance by automatically analyzing and improving website accessibility, particularly focusing on older users (60+) and those with disabilities.

## Technical Objectives

### Core System Components

1. **Criteria Extraction Module**
   - Input: EAA and WCAG 2.2 guidelines
   - Process: LLM analysis to extract key accessibility criteria
   - Output: Structured accessibility criteria for scoring

2. **Raw Data Collection Tool**
   - Purpose: Website HTML/CSS extraction
   - Requirements: Ability to parse and store complete website structure
   - Output: Raw website data in analyzable format

3. **Scoring Engine**
   - Input: Website raw data + accessibility criteria
   - Process: LLM-based analysis or deterministic algorithm
   - Output: Numerical/categorical accessibility score
   - Key Feature: Consistent, reproducible scoring methodology

4. **Improvement Recommendation System**
   - Input: Raw data + criteria + current score
   - Process: LLM analysis
   - Output: High-level improvement recommendations
   - Format: Actionable list of structural changes

5. **Implementation Tool**
   - Input: Original code + improvement recommendations
   - Process: AI-driven code transformation
   - Output: Improved HTML/CSS meeting accessibility criteria
   - Integration: Compatible with Cursor or similar AI development tools

6. **Score Verification System**
   - Purpose: Validate improvements
   - Process: Compare original vs. modified website scores
   - Feature: Iterative improvement capability

## Development Phases

1. **Initial Testing Phase (By January 5)**
   - Manual criteria extraction
   - Basic scoring system
   - Manual improvement recommendations
   - Initial test with one user

2. **Refinement Phase (By January 12)**
   - Finalized criteria
   - Enhanced scoring system
   - Improved recommendation system
   - Additional user testing

3. **System Integration (By January 19)**
   - Final criteria implementation
   - Completed scoring system
   - Begin automation process

4. **Automation Phase (By February 2)**
   - Full system automation
   - End-to-end process integration
   - Configurable parameters

## Validation Requirements

### Testing Methodology
- Comparative analysis of original vs. modified websites

- Multiple task completion scenarios
- Control for environmental variables

### Success Metrics
- Improved accessibility scores
- Reduced task completion time
- Enhanced user experience ratings
- Compliance with EAA requirements
- Consistent scoring across multiple iterations
