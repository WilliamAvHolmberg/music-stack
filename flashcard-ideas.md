# Flashcard Learning System Design

## Core Learning Strategy
1. **Progressive Mastery**
   - Start with foundational concepts (Level 1)
   - Advance based on demonstrated understanding
   - Return to basics when struggling with advanced topics
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment

2. **Spaced Repetition Schedule**
   - Initial test: Immediate understanding
   - Wrong answer: Repeat after 10 minutes
   - Correct but uncertain: Repeat after 1 hour
   - Correct and confident: Progress to next interval
   - Standard intervals: 10min → 1h → 1d → 1w → 1m → 3m
   - Reset intervals on wrong answers

3. **Wrong Answer Recovery**
   - Immediate visual feedback
   - Show simplified version first
   - Present related foundational concepts
   - Offer progressive hints
   - Ask for thought process explanation
   - Show real-world examples
   - Create sub-cards for complex topics

4. **Metacognitive Enhancement**
   - Confidence rating for each answer
   - Difficulty perception feedback
   - Self-explanation prompts
   - Understanding verification questions
   - Knowledge gap identification

## Question Types & Formats
1. **Core Understanding**
   - Definition questions
   - Concept explanations
   - Term clarification
   - Multiple choice options

2. **Relationship Mapping**
