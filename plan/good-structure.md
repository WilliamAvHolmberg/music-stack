Key benefits:
Features are self-contained - easy to copy/delete entire domains
Clear separation between feature-specific and shared code
Easier to understand "what this app does" by looking at Features/
Better for AI to understand relationships (everything related to "Reviews" is in one place)
Clearer boundaries between domains
Infrastructure concerns are isolated from business logic
Each feature can have its own models/services/controllers without polluting root folders
This structure scales well as you add more features and makes it trivial to lift-and-shift entire domains between projects.
