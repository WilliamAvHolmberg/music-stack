Ah yes! Now we're talking proper MVP! Let's break this down:

Phase 1: Text Input & Structuring

Frontend:
1. Simple text area to paste content
2. "Analyze" button
3. Display proposed structure as an interactive view:
   - Main concepts highlighted
   - Relationships shown (maybe simple lines connecting related concepts)
   - Option to edit/delete/add connections
4. "Accept Structure" button

Backend endpoints:
```
POST /api/analyze-text
- Input: raw text
- Output: structured content with relationships

POST /api/save-structure
- Input: approved structure
- Output: saved confirmation, structure ID
```

Database (super simple):
```
StudyStructures
- Id
- Title
- CreatedDate
- LastModified

Concepts
- Id
- StructureId
- Content
- Type (main concept, supporting detail, etc.)

Relationships
- Id
- StructureId
- SourceConceptId
- TargetConceptId
```

Phase 2: Flashcard Generation & Learning

Frontend:
1. List of saved structures
2. "Generate Flashcards" button
3. Review interface:
   - Displays proposed flashcard
   - Accept/Reject buttons
   - Optional feedback field
   - AI suggestion why this card is useful
4. Learning patterns dashboard (simple start):
   - Types of cards accepted/rejected
   - AI insights about learning preferences

Backend additions:
```
POST /api/generate-flashcards
- Input: structure ID
- Output: proposed flashcards

POST /api/flashcard-feedback
- Input: card ID, accepted/rejected, optional feedback
- Output: updated recommendations, AI response
```

Additional tables:
```
Flashcards
- Id
- StructureId
- Question
- Answer
- Status (accepted/rejected)
- FeedbackNotes
```

The AI would:
1. First pass: Structure the content, identify main concepts
2. Second pass: Generate flashcards based on the structure
3. Learn from feedback: Track patterns in acceptances/rejections
4. Provide personalized suggestions: "I notice you prefer cards that use analogies..."





Project Overview:
A personal learning assistant that helps structure educational content and create customized flashcards. The system emphasizes user feedback and adaptation.
Core Features - Phase 1:

Text Analysis


User pastes plain text content into a text area
System analyzes and proposes a structured representation:

Key concepts identified
Relationships between concepts mapped
Unnecessary content removed


User can review and modify the proposed structure
Approved structure is saved to database


Flashcard Generation


System generates flashcards from saved structures
Each card is presented for user review
User accepts/rejects cards with optional feedback
System learns from user preferences
AI provides reasoning for rejected cards' potential value

StudyStructures
(Id, Title, CreatedDate, LastModified)

Concepts
(Id, StructureId, Content, Type)

Relationships
(Id, StructureId, SourceConceptId, TargetConceptId)

Flashcards
(Id, StructureId, Question, Answer, Status, FeedbackNotes)


POST /api/analyze-text
- Accepts: Raw text content
- Returns: Structured content with relationships

POST /api/save-structure
- Accepts: Approved structure
- Returns: Structure ID and confirmation

POST /api/generate-flashcards
- Accepts: Structure ID
- Returns: List of proposed flashcards

POST /api/flashcard-feedback
- Accepts: Card ID, acceptance status, feedback
- Returns: AI insights and next recommendations


Implement text input and analysis
Create structure review interface
Add structure storage
Implement flashcard generation
Add flashcard review system
Implement feedback learning system

Each feature should be tested independently before moving to the next. User feedback should be gathered at each step to ensure the system is actually helpful for learning.
